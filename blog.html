                    <p> Universal mask use could prevent nearly 130,000 deaths from Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, in the United States through next spring, scientists reported on Friday.
                        The findings follow an assertion by Dr. Scott W. Atlas, the president’s science adviser, that masks are ineffective, in a tweet later taken down by Twitter for spreading misinformation. On Wednesday, 
                        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new guidance recommending mask use in public settings, including public transportation. <br>

                        The creator of hit Netflix show Emily in Paris has defended the programme following criticism that its view of the city is idealised and clichéd
                        US writer and executive producer Darren Star said he was "not sorry for looking at Paris through a glamorous lens".
                        The show follows a young American, played by Lily Collins, who travels to the French capital for work.It has been criticised, particularly in France, for promoting stereotypical images of the city and its residents.
                        "No cliché is spared, not even the most desperate," wrote Premiere's Charles Martin in his French-language review when the show made its debut earlier this month.<br>

                    <p>"We really did kind of make a mess."
                        That was Dante Lauretta's take after reviewing the first pictures to come down from Nasa's Osiris-Rex probe following its bid to grab a sample from asteroid Bennu on Tuesday.
                        Dust and grit flew in all directions but that was good news, enthused the University of Arizona professor. <br>

                    <h2>More pollution expected from stay-home workers</h2>
                    <h5>By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst, Oct 22, 2020</h5>
                    <div class="fakeimg" style="background-position: center; height:300px; background-image: url(img/pollution.jpg);"></div>
                    <p>
                        Air pollution in big cities could increase because so many people are working from home, a report says.
                        Gas burning from boilers is a major source of local pollution, accounting for 21% of total NOx emissions across Greater London, for instance. 
                        Computer modelling predicts that boiler use will rise by 56% this winter due to coronavirus changing work patterns.
                        The report assumes that workers’ offices will continue to be heated for staff still needed in the workplace. <br>
